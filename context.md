# Session Context Summary (2025年10月20日)

This document summarizes the key interactions, decisions, and technical changes made during sessions with AI assistants.

## Overall Goal

Implement a fully functional (read/write) global leaderboard for the `js7800` emulator using Cloudflare Pages for the frontend and a Cloudflare Worker with KV storage for the backend.

## Key Decisions & Changes

### 1. Cloudflare Worker Setup & Integration

- **Initial Problem**: The original global leaderboard at `https://twitchasylum.com/x/` was inaccessible due to CORS restrictions.
- **Solution**: Implement a Cloudflare Worker to act as a proxy and backend for the leaderboard.
- **KV Namespace**: User chose `js7800globalhiscore` as the KV Namespace name.
- **Worker Code (`cloudflare-worker/leaderboard-worker.js`)**:
    - **Initial Version**: Handled `GET /?d=<digest>` (read scores from KV/original source) and `POST /?d=<digest>` (save scores to KV).
    - **Updated Version (for Leaderboard Page)**: Expanded to handle additional endpoints required by the leaderboard page:
        - `GET /summary`: Proxies to `https://twitchasylum.com/x/scoreboard-summary.php`
        - `GET /games`: Proxies to `https://twitchasylum.com/x/scoreboard-games.php`
        - `GET /scores?d=<digest>`: Proxies to `https://twitchasylum.com/x/scoreboard-scores.php?d=<digest>`
    - **CORS**: Added `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` headers.
- **Frontend Integration (`site/src/js/highscore.js`)**:
    - Added `const WORKER_URL = "https://js7800-leaderboard-worker.johantw.workers.dev";`
    - Modified `xhr.open` calls in `loadSramGlobal` and `saveSramGlobal` to use `WORKER_URL` for individual game score operations.
- **Leaderboard Page Integration (`site/leaderboard/src/js/leaderboard.js`)**:
    - Added `const WORKER_URL = "https://js7800-leaderboard-worker.johantw.workers.dev";`
    - Modified `read` function calls in `refreshSummary`, `loadScores`, and `loadGamesList` to use `WORKER_URL` with the new Worker endpoints (`/summary`, `/scores`, `/games`).

### 2. Cloudflare Pages Deployment Debugging

- **`ERR_OSSL_EVP_UNSUPPORTED` Error**:
    - **Cause**: Node.js v22.16.0 on Cloudflare Pages encountered compatibility issues with older OpenSSL routines used by Webpack.
    - **Fix**: Added `NODE_OPTIONS` environment variable with value `--openssl-legacy-provider` in Cloudflare Pages settings.
- **`js7800.min.js` Not Found / `ReferenceError: js7800 is not defined`**:
    - **Cause**: The Cloudflare Pages build command was `npm run buildSite`, which only built the site-specific JS, not the core `js7800.min.js` library.
    - **Fix**: Changed Cloudflare Pages build command to `npm run build` (which runs a full build).
- **`sh: 1: copyfiles: not found` Error**:
    - **Cause**: The `copyfiles` utility, used in the `buildLeaderboard` script, was not installed in the build environment.
    - **Fix**: Added `copyfiles` to `devDependencies` in `package.json` and instructed user to run `npm install` locally to update `package-lock.json`.
- **Leaderboard Page Blank / `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<'`**:
    - **Cause**: `site/leaderboard/index.html` was missing from the deployed site, causing Cloudflare Pages to serve a default HTML page when `/leaderboard/` was accessed.
    - **Fix**: Created `site/leaderboard/index.html` and updated `package.json`'s `buildLeaderboard` script to copy it to `site/deploy/leaderboard/`.
- **Leaderboard Page Blank / `TypeError: leaderboard.init is not a function`**:
    - **Cause**: The `leaderboard.js` module exports a `start` function, but `index.html` was incorrectly calling `leaderboard.init()`.
    - **Fix**: Modified `site/leaderboard/index.html` to call `leaderboard.start()`.
- **Leaderboard Page Blank / `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'appendChild')`**:
    - **Cause**: The `site/leaderboard/index.html` was too minimal and lacked the necessary HTML elements (with specific IDs) that `leaderboard.js` expected to find and manipulate (e.g., `scores-table-table`, `top-players-top-10`).
    - **Fix**: Provided a more complete `site/leaderboard/index.html` with all the required HTML structure and IDs.

### 3. Leaderboard Page HTML & CSS Fixes

- **Problem**: The leaderboard page displayed incorrectly with layout issues.
- **Solution**:
    - **Restored complete CSS**: Added all 500+ lines of CSS from the original author's HTML file.
    - **Fixed layout**: Changed from flexbox to float-based layout (3-column: left 200px, center 700px, right 200px).
    - **Fixed text colors**: Changed table text color from #999 to #CCC for better visibility.
    - **Restored proper structure**: Left panel (Top Players + Latest Scores) | Center (Game selector + Scores table) | Right (Top Players Most Competitive + Most Competitive Modes).

### 4. Leaderboard Header Styling

- **Problem**: The leaderboard title didn't match the original author's design.
- **Solutions**:
    - **Bold JS7800**: Wrapped "JS7800" in `<strong>` tag for bold styling.
    - **GitHub Icon**: 
        - Used SVG file reference (`../images/github-logo.svg`) instead of base64 encoding.
        - Linked to user's fork: `https://github.com/anomixer/js7800`.
        - JS7800 text also linked to original author's page: `https://raz0red.github.io/js7800/`.

### 5. Hidden Play and Refresh Buttons

- **Problem**: Two buttons (Play and Refresh) were appearing in the leaderboard page.
- **Solution**: Added CSS to hide both buttons:
    ```css
    #play-button {
      display: none;
    }
    
    #restart-button {
      display: none;
    }
    ```

## Current Status

- ✅ Frontend deployed to Cloudflare Pages (`https://js7800.pages.dev/`).
- ✅ Cloudflare Worker deployed and functional for data fetching.
- ✅ Main emulator UI and i18n working correctly.
- ✅ Leaderboard page displaying correctly with proper 3-column layout.
- ✅ Leaderboard header styled like original author (bold JS7800 + GitHub icon).
- ✅ Play and Refresh buttons hidden.

## Next Steps

- Update documentation (README.md, context.md, warp.md) to reflect Global Leaderboard Synchronization approach.
- Document Cloudflare Workers & Pages deployment steps.
