# Session Context Summary (2025年10月19日)

This document summarizes the key interactions, decisions, and technical changes made during the session with the Gemini CLI agent.

## Overall Goal

Implement a fully functional (read/write) global leaderboard for the `js7800` emulator using Cloudflare Pages for the frontend and a Cloudflare Worker with KV storage for the backend.

## Key Decisions & Changes

### 1. Cloudflare Worker Setup & Integration

- **Initial Problem**: The original global leaderboard at `https://twitchasylum.com/x/` was inaccessible due to CORS restrictions.
- **Solution**: Implement a Cloudflare Worker to act as a proxy and backend for the leaderboard.
- **KV Namespace**: User chose `js7800globalhiscore` as the KV Namespace name.
- **Worker Code (`cloudflare-worker/leaderboard-worker.js`)**:
    - **Initial Version**: Handled `GET /?d=<digest>` (read scores from KV/original source) and `POST /?d=<digest>` (save scores to KV).
    - **Updated Version (for Leaderboard Page)**: Expanded to handle additional endpoints required by the leaderboard page:
        - `GET /summary`: Proxies to `https://twitchasylum.com/x/scoreboard-summary.php`
        - `GET /games`: Proxies to `https://twitchasylum.com/x/scoreboard-games.php`
        - `GET /scores?d=<digest>`: Proxies to `https://twitchasylum.com/x/scoreboard-scores.php?d=<digest>`
    - **CORS**: Added `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` headers.
- **Frontend Integration (`site/src/js/highscore.js`)**:
    - Added `const WORKER_URL = "https://js7800-leaderboard-worker.johantw.workers.dev";`
    - Modified `xhr.open` calls in `loadSramGlobal` and `saveSramGlobal` to use `WORKER_URL` for individual game score operations.
- **Leaderboard Page Integration (`site/leaderboard/src/js/leaderboard.js`)**:
    - Added `const WORKER_URL = "https://js7800-leaderboard-worker.johantw.workers.dev";`
    - Modified `read` function calls in `refreshSummary`, `loadScores`, and `loadGamesList` to use `WORKER_URL` with the new Worker endpoints (`/summary`, `/scores`, `/games`).

### 2. Cloudflare Pages Deployment Debugging

- **`ERR_OSSL_EVP_UNSUPPORTED` Error**:
    - **Cause**: Node.js v22.16.0 on Cloudflare Pages encountered compatibility issues with older OpenSSL routines used by Webpack.
    - **Fix**: Added `NODE_OPTIONS` environment variable with value `--openssl-legacy-provider` in Cloudflare Pages settings.
- **`js7800.min.js` Not Found / `ReferenceError: js7800 is not defined`**:
    - **Cause**: The Cloudflare Pages build command was `npm run buildSite`, which only built the site-specific JS, not the core `js7800.min.js` library.
    - **Fix**: Changed Cloudflare Pages build command to `npm run build` (which runs a full build).
- **`sh: 1: copyfiles: not found` Error**:
    - **Cause**: The `copyfiles` utility, used in the `buildLeaderboard` script, was not installed in the build environment.
    - **Fix**: Added `copyfiles` to `devDependencies` in `package.json` and instructed user to run `npm install` locally to update `package-lock.json`.
- **Leaderboard Page Blank / `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<'`**:
    - **Cause**: `site/leaderboard/index.html` was missing from the deployed site, causing Cloudflare Pages to serve a default HTML page when `/leaderboard/` was accessed.
    - **Fix**: Created `site/leaderboard/index.html` and updated `package.json`'s `buildLeaderboard` script to copy it to `site/deploy/leaderboard/`.
- **Leaderboard Page Blank / `TypeError: leaderboard.init is not a function`**:
    - **Cause**: The `leaderboard.js` module exports a `start` function, but `index.html` was incorrectly calling `leaderboard.init()`.
    - **Fix**: Modified `site/leaderboard/index.html` to call `leaderboard.start()`.
- **Leaderboard Page Blank / `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'appendChild')`**:
    - **Cause**: The `site/leaderboard/index.html` was too minimal and lacked the necessary HTML elements (with specific IDs) that `leaderboard.js` expected to find and manipulate (e.g., `scores-table-table`, `top-players-top-10`).
    - **Fix**: Provided a more complete `site/leaderboard/index.html` with all the required HTML structure and IDs.

### 3. Current Status

- Frontend deployed to Cloudflare Pages (`https://js7800.pages.dev/`).
- Cloudflare Worker deployed and functional for data fetching (both individual game scores and leaderboard page data).
- Main emulator UI and i18n are working.
- **Leaderboard page (`https://js7800.pages.dev/leaderboard/`) is currently displaying as "messed up" (visually incorrect layout/styling), indicating a likely CSS application issue.** The user reports no new JavaScript errors in the console, and network requests for data are successful.

## Next Steps (Pending)

- Diagnose and fix the CSS application issue on the leaderboard page. This will involve further inspection of the browser's Developer Tools (Elements and Styles tabs) to determine if CSS is being injected, if rules are present, and if they are being applied correctly.
